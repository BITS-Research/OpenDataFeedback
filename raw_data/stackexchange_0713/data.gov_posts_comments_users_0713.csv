<p>how to make govendor and ""code"" treat vendor dir properly? what I'm doing here wrong?</p>

<p>code example:</p>

<pre><code>import (
    ""fmt""
    ""log""

    flag ""github.com/spf13/pflag""

    ""github.com/openshift/origin/pkg/cmd/util/clientcmd""
    kapi ""k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/api""
)

func main() {
    flags := flag.FlagSet{}
    factory := clientcmd.New(&amp;flags)
...
</code></pre>

<p>and it complains on flags being used wrongly. </p>

The technical answers require more effort to put together, but they seem to get few or no upvotes.  I think people don't upvote answers to technical questions as much because effort is required to verify their correctness, as opposed to simply agreeing with someone's subjective opinion.<br><br>

The more difficult the technical question was to answer, the less people there will be with the technical capability to evaluate your answer for correctness.  Therefore the difficulty of answering the question is likely to have an inverse effect on the total upvotes received.","2121","3589","283","","","","30802","2152108","1","2152123","","2010-01-28 03:28:29","","27","1019","<p>I'm working on an app to provide an easy way for people to track the status of a bill [and various other political information].

<li><code>CURRENT</code> I have a side-project PHP-based proxy server to record requests passing through. It is highly customisable, and connects together using Docker.</li>
<li><code>FINISHED</code> I've written a <a href=""http://ilovephp.jondh.me.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PHP application development tutorial</a> for beginners.

Give it a go, and feel free to <a href=""http://blog.jondh.me.uk/2014/08/online-php-beginners-tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">add feedback</a>.</li>
<li><code>FINISHED</code> I have a PHP project to launch a real web server in the background, and to easily integrate that with PhantomJS. This is useful for functional testing an application.</li>
<li><code>FINISHED</code> If you have seen a programming tutorial online with serious security issues, let <a href=""http://awooga.jondh.me.uk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Awooga know about it</a> or <a href=""https://twitter.com/ilovephp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tweet it to me</a>.

<p>how to make govendor and ""code"" treat vendor dir properly? what I'm doing here wrong?</p>

<p>code example:</p>

<pre><code>import (
    ""fmt""
    ""log""

    flag ""github.com/spf13/pflag""

    ""github.com/openshift/origin/pkg/cmd/util/clientcmd""

)

func main() {
    flags := flag.FlagSet{}
    factory := clientcmd.New(&amp;flags)
...

Autonomous teams with quick deployment is highly desirable. In spite of theory, services are indeed dependent on each other for higher functionality, but are autonomous (independently developed and deployed). Since this is a federation model and decentralized control, we cannot impose strict rules - just like the UN. Without a governance platform that will manage dependencies else due to the multiple versions in production in different countries, we foresee uncontrollable chaos.</p>

<p>Let's call set of Microservices that needs to collaborate a ""Compatibility Set"". A service can be deployed but may not satisfy the higher functionality in its Compatibility Set.  For example MicroService A-4.3 is fully autonomous, deployed and working perfectly. However to satisfy BusinessFunctionality 8.6 it must work together with MicroService B-5.4 and MicroService C-2.9. Together (A-4.3 , B-5.4 and C-2.9) they form a ""Compatibility Set""</p>

<p>There are two approaches to this dilemma. Microservice in real life where the rubber hits the road and the learning from experience begins...</p>

<p><strong>Approach 1) Governance Platform</strong></p>

<p><em>Rationale</em>: Federal model in an International company in 100+ countries. Which means Central IT can lay down the model but individual countries can choose their own destiny - and they frequently do. It frequently devolves to chaos and the Central IT team is on the hook. DDD is the solution for an ideal world where version inconsistencies do not derail functionality like releasing services which do not fit into the Compatibility set, individually blameless but together they fall apart or result in flawed or inconsistent functionality.</p>

<ul>
<li>There is no homogeneity, there isn't even standardization of terminology</li>
<li>Developers are mixed skill, many junior, and many learning reactive programming and cloud native technologies</li>
<li>Bounded Context heavily depends on Shared Vocabulary and it can get subtle, but this is impossible to enforce and naive to assume in an International, mixed skill, fragmented scenario with multiple versions running</li>
<li>Standardization on a Single Business Model is not realistic in such a heterogeneous system (but ideal)</li>
</ul>

<p>How what is Central IT to do when they're held responsible for this Chaos?</p>

<p><em>Enforce a Governance Platform</em>
Create a Microservices governance system or framework to enforce dependency management. It verifies and enforces at design and run time dependencies on a particular Microservice through a manifest and performs some checks and balances to verify the service implementations being offered - the  ""Compatibility Set"". </p>

<p><strong>Approach 2)  Domain Driven Design (DDD)</strong>
DDD is about modelling domains that are constantly evolving, where domain experts (typically a business stakeholder, or perhaps an analyst) will work alongside developers to design the system. Within each domain, a ubiquitous language is formed, such that within that context, the same word always means the same thing. An important thing to realise is that in one part of your system, “Order” might mean one thing, it might mean for example a list of products. In another part of your system, “Order” might mean something else, it might mean a financial transaction that happened. This is where the model you describe can fall down, if my service needs to get a list of orders, perhaps there is a capability out there that supplies a list of orders, but which orders are they? The list of products or the financial transaction? Trying to coordinate as many developers as you have to all use the same language here is an impossible task that is doomed to fail.</p>

<p>In DDD, rather than trying to manage this at a system level and force every service to use the same definition of Order, DDD embraces the inherent complexity in coordinating very large deployments with huge numbers of developers involved, and allows each team to work independently, coordinating with other teams as needed, not through some centralised dependency management system. The term used in DDD is bounded contexts, where in one context, Order means one thing, and in another bounded context, Order can mean another thing. These contexts can function truly autonomously – you describe your services as being autonomous, but if they have to match their definition of order with the entire system by registering and supplied dependencies to a central registry, then really they are tightly coupled to the rest of the system and what it considers an order to be – you end up with all the painful coupling of a monolith, with all the pain of building a distributed system, and you won’t realise many of the benefits of microservices if you try to take this approach.</p>

<p>So a DDD based approach doesn’t ever try to take a heavy handed approach of enforcing dependencies or capabilities at the system level, rather, it allows individual teams to work without needing central coordination, if Service A needs to interact with Service B, then the team who manages Service A will work with the team that manages service B, they can build an interface between their bounded contexts, and come to an agreement on language for that interface. It is up to these teams to manage their dependencies with each other, at the system level things can remain quite opaque / unenforced.</p>

<p>Too often we see people implement “Microservices” but end up with a system that is just as, if not more inflexible, and often more fragile, than a monolith. Also called a ""Minilith"" or ""Monolith 2.0"" Microservices require a complete rethink of architecture and software development processes, and require not just allowing services to be autonomous and independently managed, but also for teams to be independent, not centrally managed. Centralising the management of dependencies and capabilities in a system is likely to be an inhibitor to successfully building a microservice based system.</p>

<p><strong>Intelligent and Pragmatic comments invited...</strong></p>

<p>Approach 1 (Governance) is pragmatic and tactical and intended to solve very real challenges. Question is - will it undermine the long term strategic DDD model of the Enterprise?</p>

<p>Approach 2 (DDD) is ideal and aspirational but doesn't address the very real challenges that we have to deal with right now. </p>

I did, and I don't want to go deep into the class graph to learn about every nook and cranny of Governor. I indeed saw that `LifecycleModule` is the only concrete module loaded, but what is the rest up to? Do I have to do anything? I think it's acceptable to read documentation to find out such answers. But code? No, I think it's too much, especially when it can be adapted rather quickly when the documentation is more static.","2015-11-20 21:26:57","","180719","180719","8664","2009-09-28 20:50:24","Olivier Grégoire","2017-07-11 10:55:47","","","","741","1552","52","https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Ho4A.png?s=128&g=1","","","60521","33830570","1","","","2015-11-20 15:40:42","","1","30","<p>I want to use the lifecycle feature of Governator without calling <code>Governator.createInjector</code> because I already have some wrapper around my Guice injector and switching the two will be rather tricky.</p>

<p>I have found a very nice jquery plugin, called jsTree. Unfortunately, in order to process JSON documents it requires data to have a very specific verbose (and redundant, in my opinion) structure: <a href=""http://www.jstree.com/documentation/json_data"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a>. Using it means significant modifications of my json documents. I am rather searching for a tool that is able to build the tree automagically, without making severe manual adjustments to the data, yet allowing me to potentially apply some modifications to the view, if I would need to.</p>

<p>The tool at json.bloople.net makes something similar using a table, but because I have several levels of nested documents, the output looks very bloated. Moreover, the structure is not dynamically collapsible. </p>

<p>I would appreciate any hints regarding the right tools to do the job, including both those that might require (automated!) pre-processing of JSON data in Java/Groovy or pure JavaScript-based solution.</p>

************** JIT Debugging **************
To enable just-in-time (JIT) debugging, the .config file for this
application or computer (machine.config) must have the
jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.
The application must also be compiled with debugging

For example:

When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception

<p>I'm completely stumped, and from my Googling so is the rest of the Intenet-at-large. The query worked correctly before I added the date created $match operator. It's possible that the error belongs to MongoVUE and not MongoDB itself.</p>

<p>The relevant portion of the schema looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>{

<p>Can anybody help me find the cause of this error? I'm afraid I'm completely stumped.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm not allowed to answer my own question (because apparently it's utterly impossible to find the answer yourself in under 8 hours if your StackOverflow reputation is too low? Huh?) So I'm posting the answer below:</p>

<p>Ok I found the answer, as far as I can determine it is indeed a bug (or at least an omission and a misleading error message) in MongoVUE. Writing the same query (with orid's modifications to it) in this way works:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""$match"": {
    ""Created"": {
      ""$gte"": ISODate(""2014-01-10T00:00:00Z"")
    }
  }
},
{
  ""$group"": {
    ""_id"": {
      ""year"": {
        ""$year"": ""$Created""
      },
      ""month"": {
        ""$month"": ""$Created""
      },
      ""day"": {
        ""$dayOfMonth"": ""$Created""
      }
    },
    ""count"": {
      ""$sum"": 1
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Note the only change I really made was removing the array markers around it.)</p>

<p>Additionally, that error appears <em>any</em> time you put an aggregation with more than one operation in an array in MongoVUE. If you leave off the array, the operations work fine. If you add it, suddenly you get ""each item in the pipeline must be a document.""</p>

<p>So, for example:</p>

<pre><code>package mypackage

import tpp ""github.com/thirdpartycompany/thirdpartypackage""

func Build() *tpp.SharedStruct{
   //...implementation
}

<p>The package that exposes <code>SharedStruct</code> is vendored inside <code>mypackage</code>, because I want to distribute it and make that package independent. </p>

<p>Now, after importing <code>mypackage</code> in another project and using <code>thirdpartypackage</code> in my tests (I need it to make some integration tests), I'm seeing the following error:</p>

<p>Basically the compiler is distinguishing the vendored third-party package inside my library and the vendored package that I put in my main project.</p>

<p>Are there ways to solve this issue (that are not removing the vendored dependencies from my library, like suggested <a href=""https://forum.golangbridge.org/t/vendoring-and-multiple-versions-of-the-same-library/2010/6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>)? Or I'm missing something?</p>

************** JIT Debugging **************
To enable just-in-time (JIT) debugging, the .config file for this
application or computer (machine.config) must have the
jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.
The application must also be compiled with debugging
enabled.

For example:

&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;system.windows.forms jitDebugging=""true"" /&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;

When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception
will be sent to the JIT debugger registered on the computer
rather than be handled by this dialog box.

<p>I can then do everthing from mongo console. But when I try to connect an admin UI such as Mongovue or Robomongo, I get connection refused. Mongovue spits out this stack trace:</p>

","4076","4498","7","https://i.stack.imgur.com/aTFoe.jpg?s=128&g=1","","","1886487","40431320","1","","","2016-11-04 20:35:53","","1","129","<p>I was getting a compile error which led me to believe that I had the wrong version of a library in my vendor folder. The first task was to determine what revision of the library was correct. I needed to find the version of the library source that contained the string ""VolumeCreateRequest"". For that I used this trick from the root folder of the library:</p>

<pre><code>git rev-list --all | xargs git grep VolumeCreateRequest
</code></pre>

<p>From that I found the version hash: <code>06f160237426e705ed214a4f087d4aeea32c0a8b</code>:</p>

<p>So then I tried to add that version into my vendor folder
<code>go vendor add github.com/docker/docker/...@06f160237426e705ed214a4f087d4aeea32c0a8b</code></p>

<p>But it doesn't work. When I check the library's version using git it does <em>not</em> report the version I just fetched. </p>

<pre><code>git log -n 1 --pretty=format:""%H""
</code></pre>

<p>The vendor.json file also contains the wrong version</p>

<p>so what's up? After carefully reading the docs I see go vender <em>add</em> just silently ignores the <code>@06f160237426e705ed214a4f087d4aeea32c0a8b</code> on the end of my fetch URI.</p>

<p>The correct command is go vendor <strong>fetch</strong> which supports the @version</p>

<p><code>govendor fetch  github.com/docker/docker/...@06f160237426e705ed214a4f087d4aeea32c0a8b</code> </p>

<p>Another way to accomplish this is to git checkout the version you want of the library, in your GOPATH (i.e. not in your vendor folder), then <code>govendor add</code> the package from your GOPATH</p>

<p>So now I check the git version and we are all good. Then the next problem occurred. Our generate.go file (invoked by <code>go generate</code>) is going in and overwriting the desired version in my <code>vendor.json</code> with what was on my GOPATH.</p>

<p>The sequence in our <code>generate.go</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>//go:generate govendor add +external
//go:generate govendor fetch +missing
//go:generate go vendor sync
</code></pre>

<p>This turned out to be wrong because the add would overwrite my changes, then the sync is ineffectual because vendor.json already infected with wrong version.</p>

<p>The correct sequence is this:</p>

<pre><code>//go:generate govendor sync
//go:generate govendor add +external
//go:generate govendor fetch +missing
</code></pre>

<p>In this way, your customized vendor.json will sync the vendor folder to what is <em>desired</em> first, and only <em>after</em> that will external and missing dependencies be downloaded.</p>

<p>Finally, several dependencies actually would not compile at all do to platform specific stuff. To cure this, I add these lines in generate.go to remove those broken dependencies, <em>after</em> I sync, add, fetch</p>

<pre><code>//go:generate govendor remove github.com/docker/docker/runconfig
//go:generate govendor remove github.com/docker/docker/libcontainerd
//go:generate govendor remove github.com/docker/libcompose/test
//go:generate govendor remove github.com/Microsoft/...

The paradigm I've started using for our libraries intended for import (as opposed to apps themselves) is to add `/vendor/*/` to our `.gitignore`.  This ignores subfolders in `/vendor/`, but NOT files (like `vendor.json`, for govendor).  Govendor then gracefully handles flattening the dependency tree, and your error vanishes, because both packages are now using the same fully-qualified import path for the structure's package.","2016-12-12 20:08:28","","4551301","4551301","2053","2015-02-10 16:19:02","Kaedys","2017-06-27 19:25:04","","","","84","106","22","https://i.stack.imgur.com/d1kFH.jpg?s=128&g=1&g=1","","","5766499","41099027","1","","","2016-12-12 10:43:49","","0","198","<p>let's assume I have a package <code>mypackage</code> that exposes one method, for instance <code>Build()</code>, that returns a concrete struct exposed by a third party library, let's called <code>thirdpartypackage</code></p>

<pre><code>package mypackage

import tpp ""github.com/thirdpartycompany/thirdpartypackage""

func Build() *tpp.SharedStruct{

<p>The package that exposes <code>SharedStruct</code> is vendored inside <code>mypackage</code>, because I want to distribute it and make that package independent. </p>

<p>Basically the compiler is distinguishing the vendored third-party package inside my library and the vendored package that I put in my main project.</p>

<p>Are there ways to solve this issue (that are not removing the vendored dependencies from my library, like suggested <a href=""https://forum.golangbridge.org/t/vendoring-and-multiple-versions-of-the-same-library/2010/6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>)? Or I'm missing something?</p>

Here is my complete config file:</p>

<pre><code>systemLog:

<p>I created a superuser like this:</p>

<pre><code>db.createUser({user:""superuser"", pwd:""temp"",
roles:[ ""userAdminAnyDatabase"", ""readWrite"" ] } )
</code></pre>

<p>I can log into mongo console like this:</p>

<pre><code>mongo.exe 127.0.0.1:27017/admin  -u superuser -p temp --authenticationDatabase admin --verbose
</code></pre>

<p>I can then do everthing from mongo console. But when I try to connect an admin UI such as Mongovue or Robomongo, I get connection refused. Mongovue spits out this stack trace:</p>

<pre><code>Connection was refused

If we login to the server box running mongodb, and then start a mongo shell, then we are able to view the collections.
Is this a known problem - that the existing tools like Robomongo and MongoVUE which have been supporting up to 2.6.X are not yet supporting mongodb 3.0.0? 
Is there any mongo client that supports version 3.0.0?</p>

I might get 6 complete asset blocks on the first row, 3 right aligned on the next, 1 right aligned on the next, another complete row of 6 on the next etc...).  I'm assuming its to do with the styling (css) of the asset blocks.  If I change the browser screen size by reducing it slightly then the asset blocks will readjust and whilst some of the gaps get filled, there are still spaces in the rows.  Is anyone able to advise on what I might need to do to fix this styling issue?  This occurs consistently in both Firefox (v50.0.2), Chrome (v55) and IE (v11).</p>

<p>The spacing appears to occur directly beneath the asset in a row that has the longest description (where all the descriptions are the same length then the spacing does not occur).</p>

I might get 6 complete asset blocks on the first row, 3 right aligned on the next, 1 right aligned on the next, another complete row of 6 on the next etc...).  I'm assuming its to do with the styling (css) of the asset blocks.  If I change the browser screen size by reducing it slightly then the asset blocks will readjust and whilst some of the gaps get filled, there are still spaces in the rows.  Is anyone able to advise on what I might need to do to fix this styling issue?  This occurs consistently in both Firefox (v50.0.2), Chrome (v55) and IE (v11).</p>

<p>So, for example:</p>

<pre><code>package mypackage

import tpp ""github.com/thirdpartycompany/thirdpartypackage""

func Build() *tpp.SharedStruct{
   //...implementation
}
</code></pre>

<p>The package that exposes <code>SharedStruct</code> is vendored inside <code>mypackage</code>, because I want to distribute it and make that package independent. </p>

<p>Now, after importing <code>mypackage</code> in another project and using <code>thirdpartypackage</code> in my tests (I need it to make some integration tests), I'm seeing the following error:</p>

<p><em>cannot use XXXX (type ""github.com/mycompany/mymainproject/vendor/github.com/mycompany/mypackage/vendor/github.com/thirdcompany/thirdpartypackage-go"".Token) as type ""github.com/empatica/mycompany/vendor/github.com/thirdcompany/thirdpartypackage""</em></p>

<p>Basically the compiler is distinguishing the vendored third-party package inside my library and the vendored package that I put in my main project.</p>

<p>Are there ways to solve this issue (that are not removing the vendored dependencies from my library, like suggested <a href=""https://forum.golangbridge.org/t/vendoring-and-multiple-versions-of-the-same-library/2010/6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>)? Or I'm missing something?</p>

<p>On mysql error logs we received a lot of access denied errors from another user, around 5000 denied connections.

<p>I activated log_warnings=2, to get more information, but we don't get an extra information. Any idea why this behavior ? or How to audit mysql to find the source of this problem ?</p>
