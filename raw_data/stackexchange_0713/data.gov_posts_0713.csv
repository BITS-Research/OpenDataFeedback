However, we find that we are not able to list any collections from our client tools and mongo shell. If we login to the server box running mongodb, and then start a mongo shell, then we are able to view the collections.
Is this a known problem - that the existing tools like Robomongo and MongoVUE which have been supporting up to 2.6.X are not yet supporting mongodb 3.0.0? 
Is there any mongo client that supports version 3.0.0?</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm not allowed to answer my own question (because apparently it's utterly impossible to find the answer yourself in under 8 hours if your StackOverflow reputation is too low? Huh?) So I'm posting the answer below:</p>

<p>Ok I found the answer, as far as I can determine it is indeed a bug (or at least an omission and a misleading error message) in MongoVUE. Writing the same query (with orid's modifications to it) in this way works:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""$match"": {
    ""Created"": {
      ""$gte"": ISODate(""2014-01-10T00:00:00Z"")
    }
  }
},
{
  ""$group"": {
    ""_id"": {
      ""year"": {
        ""$year"": ""$Created""
      },
      ""month"": {
        ""$month"": ""$Created""
      },
      ""day"": {
        ""$dayOfMonth"": ""$Created""
      }
    },
    ""count"": {
      ""$sum"": 1
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Note the only change I really made was removing the array markers around it.)</p>

<p>Additionally, that error appears <em>any</em> time you put an aggregation with more than one operation in an array in MongoVUE. If you leave off the array, the operations work fine. If you add it, suddenly you get ""each item in the pipeline must be a document.""</p>

<p>I agree that the first case is what is expected but I saw <a href=""http://blog.namwarrizvi.com/?p=212"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this post</a> and got curious. Please explain what will happen in the real scenario.</p>

<p>My use case is that I create the LifeCycleInjector by passing a DefaultGovernatorConfiguration builder to Governator.createInjector(). I have seen that this call got deprecated, but is there a way I can set the ArchaiusConfigurationProvider onto the passed-in governator configuration?
In previous versions of DefaultGovernatorConfiguration there were methods to add a BootStrap module to the configuration(which is described as the second option in the link above), but not in the latest one.</p>

<p>Also looking at the first option described in the link above, they say a provider could be configured by doing the following:</p>

<p>""Annotate the ConfigurationProvider with @AutoBindSingleton (making sure it is in the set of packages passed to the classpath scanner).""
In the case of ArchaiusConfigurationProvider, how can I exactly do this? Do I need to write a wrapper around it, and annotated with @AutoBindSingleton?</p>

<p>Also, I noticed some project karyon, which describes <a href=""http://netflix.github.io/karyon/karyon-core-javadoc/com/netflix/karyon/server/ServerBootstrap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> that it ""Binds the ArchaiusConfigurationProvider as governator's ConfigurationProvider"".

This is an assignment and I'm new to MongoDB, so I apologize if my code is not very ""pretty""; also, for all that matters, I'm using MongoVUE.</p>

<p>I have a collection called <em>cities</em> and each document has, amongst others, a <em>CountryID</em> and a <em>Name</em> field. The first part of the assignment consists in writing a MapReduce function that returns all the city-names matching a given country, <strong>keeping</strong> the duplicates and counting the amount of cities.</p>

<p>I solved this with the following setup:</p>

<pre><code>db.runCommand({ mapreduce: ""cities"", 
 map : function Map() {

    emit(
        this.CountryID,
        { ""citiesList"" : [this.Name], ""count"" : 1 }
    );
},
 reduce : function Reduce(key, values) {

    var reduced = {""citiesList"" : [], ""count"" : 0};

    values.forEach(function(val) {
        reduced.citiesList.push(val);
        reduced.count += val.count;
    });

    return reduced; 
},
 finalize : function Finalize(key, reduced) {

    return reduced;
},
 query : { ""CountryID"" : 15 },
 out : { inline : 1 }
 });
</code></pre>

<p>Now I should improve my answer in order to exclude the duplicates, counting the amount of documents in the new collection. I managed to get this information through the console with <code>db.cities.distinct(""City"", {""CountryID"" : 15});</code> (not supported in MongoVUE afaik), but I can't seem to get a solution with MapReduce (please note that I <strong>must use MapReduce</strong>, not <em>aggregate</em>).</p>

<p>My idea: add an <em>if</em> condition in my reduce function, in order to only push values that are not already in my list. That would be something like</p>

<pre><code>    values.forEach(function(val) {
    if(!reduced.citiesList.contains(val)) { // val not contained
        reduced.citiesList.push(val);
        reduced.count += val.count;
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This won't work, I tried to use the <em>$in</em> and <em>$exists</em> operators but I obviously didn't get that right, and MongoVUE isn't really helping (I don't get any error message?!).</p>

<p>Alternatively, I thought about iterating through my list in the <em>finalize</em> function and removing the duplicates, but I also couldn't find a way of doing that (NOTE: I want to <strong>exclude</strong> them from my output, not delete them from the collection).</p>

<p>What I'd like to know is:</p>

<p>a) am I on the right track here or did I get it all wrong? the assignment was pretty easy so far and I might be overlooking a simple solution</p>

<p>b) any hint on how to modify my existing solution to make it work?</p>

"40660163","1","","","2016-11-17 16:30:32","","2","129","<p><strong>Background</strong>: an international company with a federation model is transforming into Microservices due to chronic Monolithic pain. Autonomous teams with quick deployment is highly desirable. In spite of theory, services are indeed dependent on each other for higher functionality, but are autonomous (independently developed and deployed). Since this is a federation model and decentralized control, we cannot impose strict rules - just like the UN. Without a governance platform that will manage dependencies else due to the multiple versions in production in different countries, we foresee uncontrollable chaos.</p>

<p>Let's call set of Microservices that needs to collaborate a ""Compatibility Set"". A service can be deployed but may not satisfy the higher functionality in its Compatibility Set.  For example MicroService A-4.3 is fully autonomous, deployed and working perfectly. However to satisfy BusinessFunctionality 8.6 it must work together with MicroService B-5.4 and MicroService C-2.9. Together (A-4.3 , B-5.4 and C-2.9) they form a ""Compatibility Set""</p>

<p>There are two approaches to this dilemma. Microservice in real life where the rubber hits the road and the learning from experience begins...</p>

<p><strong>Approach 1) Governance Platform</strong></p>

<p><em>Rationale</em>: Federal model in an International company in 100+ countries. Which means Central IT can lay down the model but individual countries can choose their own destiny - and they frequently do. It frequently devolves to chaos and the Central IT team is on the hook. DDD is the solution for an ideal world where version inconsistencies do not derail functionality like releasing services which do not fit into the Compatibility set, individually blameless but together they fall apart or result in flawed or inconsistent functionality.</p>

<ul>
<li>There is no homogeneity, there isn't even standardization of terminology</li>
<li>Developers are mixed skill, many junior, and many learning reactive programming and cloud native technologies</li>
<li>Bounded Context heavily depends on Shared Vocabulary and it can get subtle, but this is impossible to enforce and naive to assume in an International, mixed skill, fragmented scenario with multiple versions running</li>
<li>Standardization on a Single Business Model is not realistic in such a heterogeneous system (but ideal)</li>
</ul>

<p>How what is Central IT to do when they're held responsible for this Chaos?</p>

<p><em>Enforce a Governance Platform</em>
Create a Microservices governance system or framework to enforce dependency management. It verifies and enforces at design and run time dependencies on a particular Microservice through a manifest and performs some checks and balances to verify the service implementations being offered - the  ""Compatibility Set"". </p>

<p><strong>Approach 2)  Domain Driven Design (DDD)</strong>
DDD is about modelling domains that are constantly evolving, where domain experts (typically a business stakeholder, or perhaps an analyst) will work alongside developers to design the system. Within each domain, a ubiquitous language is formed, such that within that context, the same word always means the same thing. An important thing to realise is that in one part of your system, “Order” might mean one thing, it might mean for example a list of products. In another part of your system, “Order” might mean something else, it might mean a financial transaction that happened. This is where the model you describe can fall down, if my service needs to get a list of orders, perhaps there is a capability out there that supplies a list of orders, but which orders are they? The list of products or the financial transaction? Trying to coordinate as many developers as you have to all use the same language here is an impossible task that is doomed to fail.</p>

<p>In DDD, rather than trying to manage this at a system level and force every service to use the same definition of Order, DDD embraces the inherent complexity in coordinating very large deployments with huge numbers of developers involved, and allows each team to work independently, coordinating with other teams as needed, not through some centralised dependency management system. The term used in DDD is bounded contexts, where in one context, Order means one thing, and in another bounded context, Order can mean another thing. These contexts can function truly autonomously – you describe your services as being autonomous, but if they have to match their definition of order with the entire system by registering and supplied dependencies to a central registry, then really they are tightly coupled to the rest of the system and what it considers an order to be – you end up with all the painful coupling of a monolith, with all the pain of building a distributed system, and you won’t realise many of the benefits of microservices if you try to take this approach.</p>

<p>So a DDD based approach doesn’t ever try to take a heavy handed approach of enforcing dependencies or capabilities at the system level, rather, it allows individual teams to work without needing central coordination, if Service A needs to interact with Service B, then the team who manages Service A will work with the team that manages service B, they can build an interface between their bounded contexts, and come to an agreement on language for that interface. It is up to these teams to manage their dependencies with each other, at the system level things can remain quite opaque / unenforced.</p>

<p>Too often we see people implement “Microservices” but end up with a system that is just as, if not more inflexible, and often more fragile, than a monolith. Also called a ""Minilith"" or ""Monolith 2.0"" Microservices require a complete rethink of architecture and software development processes, and require not just allowing services to be autonomous and independently managed, but also for teams to be independent, not centrally managed. Centralising the management of dependencies and capabilities in a system is likely to be an inhibitor to successfully building a microservice based system.</p>

<p><strong>Intelligent and Pragmatic comments invited...</strong></p>

<p>Approach 1 (Governance) is pragmatic and tactical and intended to solve very real challenges. Question is - will it undermine the long term strategic DDD model of the Enterprise?</p>

<p>Approach 2 (DDD) is ideal and aspirational but doesn't address the very real challenges that we have to deal with right now. </p>

<p>So, for example:</p>

<pre><code>package mypackage

import tpp ""github.com/thirdpartycompany/thirdpartypackage""

func Build() *tpp.SharedStruct{
   //...implementation
}
</code></pre>

<p>The package that exposes <code>SharedStruct</code> is vendored inside <code>mypackage</code>, because I want to distribute it and make that package independent. </p>

<p>Now, after importing <code>mypackage</code> in another project and using <code>thirdpartypackage</code> in my tests (I need it to make some integration tests), I'm seeing the following error:</p>

<p><em>cannot use XXXX (type ""github.com/mycompany/mymainproject/vendor/github.com/mycompany/mypackage/vendor/github.com/thirdcompany/thirdpartypackage-go"".Token) as type ""github.com/empatica/mycompany/vendor/github.com/thirdcompany/thirdpartypackage""</em></p>

<p>Basically the compiler is distinguishing the vendored third-party package inside my library and the vendored package that I put in my main project.</p>

<p>Are there ways to solve this issue (that are not removing the vendored dependencies from my library, like suggested <a href=""https://forum.golangbridge.org/t/vendoring-and-multiple-versions-of-the-same-library/2010/6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>)? Or I'm missing something?</p>

<p>First item2, becouse it contains the earliest slot.date (ISODate(""2013-01-03T23:00:00Z"")). Second item1 becouse it contains the 2nd earliest date(ISODate(""2013-01-18T23:00:00Z"")) and so on .... its also possible to sort the dates in the embedded document?</p>

<p>What i have tried:</p>

<pre><code>.sort({{slots.date : 1}})
</code></pre>

<p>But i get a syntax error. I use MongoVUE to test the query, may MongoVUE cant run sorting on embedded documentens? Its that even possible what i want to do?</p>

<p>It seems everything is fine to me. Am I wrong?</p>

<p>During my googlings I decided that MongoVue is a good management application for MongoDB by a cool user interface. So I downloaded and installed it. Here is the screen I see when I opened it:</p>

"40431320","1","","","2016-11-04 20:35:53","","1","129","<p>I was getting a compile error which led me to believe that I had the wrong version of a library in my vendor folder. The first task was to determine what revision of the library was correct. I needed to find the version of the library source that contained the string ""VolumeCreateRequest"". For that I used this trick from the root folder of the library:</p>

<pre><code>git rev-list --all | xargs git grep VolumeCreateRequest
</code></pre>

<p>From that I found the version hash: <code>06f160237426e705ed214a4f087d4aeea32c0a8b</code>:</p>

<p>So then I tried to add that version into my vendor folder
<code>go vendor add github.com/docker/docker/...@06f160237426e705ed214a4f087d4aeea32c0a8b</code></p>

<p>But it doesn't work. When I check the library's version using git it does <em>not</em> report the version I just fetched. </p>

<pre><code>git log -n 1 --pretty=format:""%H""
</code></pre>

<p>The vendor.json file also contains the wrong version</p>

<p>so what's up? After carefully reading the docs I see go vender <em>add</em> just silently ignores the <code>@06f160237426e705ed214a4f087d4aeea32c0a8b</code> on the end of my fetch URI.</p>

<p>The correct command is go vendor <strong>fetch</strong> which supports the @version</p>

<p><code>govendor fetch  github.com/docker/docker/...@06f160237426e705ed214a4f087d4aeea32c0a8b</code> </p>

<p>Another way to accomplish this is to git checkout the version you want of the library, in your GOPATH (i.e. not in your vendor folder), then <code>govendor add</code> the package from your GOPATH</p>

<p>So now I check the git version and we are all good. Then the next problem occurred. Our generate.go file (invoked by <code>go generate</code>) is going in and overwriting the desired version in my <code>vendor.json</code> with what was on my GOPATH.</p>

<p>The sequence in our <code>generate.go</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>//go:generate govendor add +external
//go:generate govendor fetch +missing
//go:generate go vendor sync
</code></pre>

<p>This turned out to be wrong because the add would overwrite my changes, then the sync is ineffectual because vendor.json already infected with wrong version.</p>

<p>The correct sequence is this:</p>

<pre><code>//go:generate govendor sync
//go:generate govendor add +external
//go:generate govendor fetch +missing
</code></pre>

<p>In this way, your customized vendor.json will sync the vendor folder to what is <em>desired</em> first, and only <em>after</em> that will external and missing dependencies be downloaded.</p>

<p>Finally, several dependencies actually would not compile at all do to platform specific stuff. To cure this, I add these lines in generate.go to remove those broken dependencies, <em>after</em> I sync, add, fetch</p>

<pre><code>//go:generate govendor remove github.com/docker/docker/runconfig
//go:generate govendor remove github.com/docker/docker/libcontainerd
//go:generate govendor remove github.com/docker/libcompose/test
//go:generate govendor remove github.com/Microsoft/...

<p>I have found a very nice jquery plugin, called jsTree. Unfortunately, in order to process JSON documents it requires data to have a very specific verbose (and redundant, in my opinion) structure: <a href=""http://www.jstree.com/documentation/json_data"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a>. Using it means significant modifications of my json documents. I am rather searching for a tool that is able to build the tree automagically, without making severe manual adjustments to the data, yet allowing me to potentially apply some modifications to the view, if I would need to.</p>

<p>The tool at json.bloople.net makes something similar using a table, but because I have several levels of nested documents, the output looks very bloated. Moreover, the structure is not dynamically collapsible. </p>

<p>I would appreciate any hints regarding the right tools to do the job, including both those that might require (automated!) pre-processing of JSON data in Java/Groovy or pure JavaScript-based solution.</p>

"4187512","1","","","2010-11-15 18:17:10","","1","581","<p>Sorry for the long introduction but before I can ask my question, I think giving the background would help understanding our problem much better.</p>

<p>We are using sql server 2008 for our web services as the backend and from time to time it takes too much time for responding back for the requests that supposed to run really fast, like taking more than 20 seconds for a select request that queries a table that has only 22 rows. We went through many potential areas that could cause the issue from indexes to stored procedures, triggers etc, and tried to optimize whatever we can like removing indexes that are not read but write frequently or adding NOLOCK for our select queries to reduce the locking of the tables (we are OK with dirty reads). </p>

<p>We also had our DBA's reviewed the server and benchmarked the components to see any bottlenecks in CPU, memory or disk subsystem, and found out that hardware-wise we are OK as well. And since the pikes are occurring occasionally, it is really hard to reproduce the error on production or development because most of the time when we rerun the same query it yields response times that we are expecting, which are short, not the one that has been experienced earlier. </p>

<p>Having said that, I almost have been suspicious about I/O although it is not seem to be a bottleneck. But I think I was just be able to reproduce the error after running an index fragmentation report for a specific table on the server, which immediately caused pikes in requests not only run against that table but also in other requests that query other tables. And since the DB, and the server, is shared with other applications we use and also from time to time queries can be run on the server and database that take long time is a common scenario for us, my suspicion regarding occasional I/O bottleneck is, I believe, becoming a fact.</p>

<p>Therefore I want to find out a way that would prioritize requests that are coming from web services which will be processed even if there are other resource sensitive queries being run. I have been looking for some kind of prioritization I described above since very beginning of the resolution process and found out that SQL Server 2008 has a feature called 'Resource Governor' that allows prioritization of the requests. </p>

<p>However, since I am not an expert on Resource Governor nor a DBA, I would like to ask other people's experience who may have used or is using Resource Governor, as well as whether I can prioritize I/O for a specific login or a specific stored procedure (For example, if one I/O intensive process is being run at the time we receive a web service request, can SQL server stops, or slows down, I/O activity for that process and give a priority to the request we just received?).</p>

<p>Thank you for anyone that spends time on reading or helping out in advance.</p>

<p>Some Hardware Details:<br>
CPU: 2x Quad Core AMD Opteron 8354<br>
Memory: 64GB<br>
Disk Subsystem: Compaq EVA8100 series (I am not sure but it should be RAID 0+1 accross 8 HP HSV210 SCSI drives)  </p>

<p>PS:And I can almost 100 percent sure that application servers are not causing the error and there is no bottleneck we can identify there.</p>

<p>Update 1:</p>

<p>I'll try to answer as much as I can for the following questions that gbn asked below. Please let me know if you are looking something else.</p>

<p>1) What kind of index and statistics maintenance do you have please?<br>
We have a weekly running job that defrags indexes every Friday. In addition to that, Auto Create Statistics and Auto Update Statistics are enabled. And the spikes are occurring in other times than the fragmentation job as well.</p>

<p>2) What kind of write data volumes do you have?<br>
Hard to answer.In addition to our web services, there is a front end application that accesses the same database and periodically resource intensive queries needs to be run to my knowledge, however, I don't know how to get, let's say weekly or daily, write amount to DB.</p>

<p>3) Have you profiled Recompilation and statistics update events?<br>
Sorry for not be able to figure out this one. I didn't understand what you are asking about by this question. Can you provide more information for this question, if possible?</p>

I've noticed that the styling of the asset blocks (image, description, version details) are not always displaying consistently and instead gaps appear on some of the rows (ie. I might get 6 complete asset blocks on the first row, 3 right aligned on the next, 1 right aligned on the next, another complete row of 6 on the next etc...).  I'm assuming its to do with the styling (css) of the asset blocks.  If I change the browser screen size by reducing it slightly then the asset blocks will readjust and whilst some of the gaps get filled, there are still spaces in the rows.  Is anyone able to advise on what I might need to do to fix this styling issue?  This occurs consistently in both Firefox (v50.0.2), Chrome (v55) and IE (v11).</p>

<p>The spacing appears to occur directly beneath the asset in a row that has the longest description (where all the descriptions are the same length then the spacing does not occur).</p>
