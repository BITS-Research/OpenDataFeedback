What does this last field represent? Is there any way to find these ""census tract numbers""? For example, for the value ""census tract= 8100.2010"", where can I find data about that census tract number?</p>

<p>The results I receive are: </p>

<pre><code>Nb_census_tract = census_tract_of_address(""200 N State Chicago IL 60601"")
</code></pre>

<p>I found this definition: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Census Tract</strong>: The census is conducted by the US Census Bureau every 10 years. It identifies certain geographic areas by census tract
  and census block. The census track reflects median numbers when it
  comes to age and income. It is a generalization about a specific area,
  not by any means an exact science or number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried to load the shape file in Postgis, and I found census tract data on the official website, but it's not specific to every block/building in the city (I found something like: Poverty rate in city, ...) and most of data are older then 2010.  Then, I tried another approach--I found a <a href=""http://www.ffiec.gov/geocode/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">service</a> where it shows census information (even in 2014, although I couldn't find the dataset in the official website). But this service gives you information from an address. I don't want to do geocoding as it takes time and my data is huge.</p>

<p>As far as I know Decennial Census are the data where you can only get fundamental demographic and housing data. I tried to explore this <a href=""http://www.fcc.gov/developers/census-block-conversions-api"" rel=""nofollow"">API</a>, but it works by getting lat/long, but in my case I have polygons.</p>

<p>I thought about getting the center of the polygon, but it's not effective.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Where can I find data by ""census tract numbers"", for example: </p>

<p>Longitude: -122.338906797
latitude: 47.609284041
census tract number = 8100.2010</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles2013/main"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles2013/main</a></p>

<p>And have been pretty successful at getting shapefiles for nearly all census-studied areas such as PUMA's (Public Use Microdata Areas), Counties, Census Block Groups, and so on. I have not however been successful at getting my hands on the MSA files there. There are CBSA files, which are to my knowledge a different, larger area-class of supra-metro regions.</p>

<p>I have access to census data for MSA regions, however, and was wondering where I might be able to get my hands on the MSA shapefile.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>There is one other possibility, however. I might be confused about the definitions of MSA's and learn that MSA's and Census ""Places"", as the regional data type is called at the data access points, are the same. They also have a shapefile set called ""Urban areas"", which is quite large and therefore I'm guessing fairly granular, so maybe that could be it, I don't know.</p>

<p>I definitely <strong>do not</strong> want accidentally start making consultancy-level evaluative comments based on inaccurate information due to different areas with some overlap but not 100% identical accidentally being confused for the same area though.</p>

<p>Quick example of that:</p>

<p>Confusing ""Greater Greenville"" (50 square mile area) in 2010 for the ""City of Greenville"" (20 square mile area) and saying, given the ""growth"" from 2000's 20 square mile area population to 2010's 50 square mile area population area and thinking that the city has undergone an high-density urban revolution in just 10 years. ""Greenville is blowing up!""</p>

<p>Any change of data-series title scares me a little to a lot so definitely looking for those MSA shapefiles. Fishing for edification on the census data structure though a bit too I guess, sorry mod's you can edit if you want</p>

<p>Ideally, I am hoping to find data that contains accounting-related features (X) which can be used to predict whether a firm will go bankrupt or not (Y). It would also be nice to find a dataset that has been used in a previous study (so that I have a benchmark for my model). Many of the datasets in the literature appear to contain around N=1000 examples with about P=5-60 features. The only dataset that I have found so far is the <a href=""https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Qualitative_Bankruptcy"" rel=""nofollow"">qualitative bankruptcy</a> dataset on UCI (which is not great since it has been derived from other data, and processed substantially). </p>

<p>More advanced and accessible technologies have made it such that you can see what areas meet certain standards, as well as the individual components that make up these standards.

<p>Do the new U.S. government open data standards require that this type of data be made available (even if only in part) to users/groups trying to determine their funding eligibility?</p>

However, I need all four together; <em>State-level</em>, <em>monthly</em> <em>youth</em> unemployment data for <em>2014 and 2015</em>. In addition to scouring their website, I have called the Bureau of Labor Statistics and they were not helpful, unfortunately. 
Alternatively, state-level monthly unemployment data on low-wage earners for 2014/2015 would work as well. 
Basically, I want to find the effects of the state-level minimum wage changes occurring on January 2015, and these affect primarily youth and other low-wage earners. 
If I could find this data at the yearly level for 2014 and 2015 instead of the monthly level, that wouldn't be too bad. It wouldn't be quite as useful as monthly, but I could still run the regression and get some results. The other elements are pretty crucial though. Thanks!!</p>

<p>The results from the second query are to be expected since NonSteroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used. My guess is that the 100 record limit is the default.</p>

<p>My question is: why does the first query return only one (random) patient record? The documentation implies that, by default, the API will return up to the first 1000 records.</p>

  <p><a href=""http://catalog.data.gov/api/3/action/package_search?rows=1000&amp;start=0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://catalog.data.gov/api/3/action/package_search?rows=1000&amp;start=0</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And increment the 'start' parameter after every request. I have run into two difficulties:</p>

<ol>
<li>It seems like I get throttled: Sometimes after a few pages or even at the first page, and other times only after 120 pages (1000 results each) I experience request timeouts, and progress becomes extremely slow (e.g. 100 kb/s). I do have an apiKey for api.data.gov (Is this actually valid for the CKAN API?), but if I include this as 'Authorization' in the http header, still timeouts occur. </li>
<li>Using an offset of 42000, often only 998 packages are returned, although it is still far from the end of the list (192.633). This occurs by doing the following request: <a href=""http://catalog.data.gov/api/3/action/package_search?rows=1000&amp;start=42000"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://catalog.data.gov/api/3/action/package_search?rows=1000&amp;start=42000</a>. Other times it actually does return 1000 results here, but returns 998 results on a later page...</li>
</ol>

<p>Can I do anything on my end to prevent the throttling from occuring, or is something else wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Update 19-3-2017</strong>:</p>

<p>I have now managed to harvest the CKAN API, by increasing the allowed timeout from 5 to 10 seconds. Still it takes quite some time to harvest all of the data, since most of the download occurs at speeds around 100 kb/s. Also, I do get a page with 998 results occasionally, although I correct for this by setting only increasing the 'start' parameter by 998 if this happens.</p>

<p>Things I tried to prevent the apparent throttling:</p>

<ul>
<li>Included pauses of up to 10 seconds between requests</li>
<li>Using a different network: Tried this both on a glass-fiber connection (150/150), and a slower VDSL network (Both from the Netherlands)</li>
<li>Tried both with the api.data.gov API key as 'Authorization' in the request header, as well as without</li>
</ul>

<p>Attempting to count the number of events that report ""hypertension"" for substance name ""venlafaxine hydrochloride"" by dose level.</p>

<p>I noticed that when searching against the drug indication, I am able to supply a logical +AND+ </p>

"3983","1","3994","","2014-11-07 15:30:43","","8","168","<p>I want to know when commercial use of US government data is permitted and for what uses.  Below, there are 5 questions that I have for 4 different primary data sources.  </p>

<p>So far, I have seen the data policy page at data.gov,
<a href=""http://www.data.gov/data-policy"">http://www.data.gov/data-policy</a>
that governs downloads (I am assuming?) only from that domain.</p>

<p>However, a lot of the primary source US government public data are not available or are partially available on data.gov (such as aggregates), but are publicly available including:</p>

<p>-(A) securities and exchange commission filings (SEC, such as the 10-Ks available on EDGAR)</p>

<p>-(B) federal elections commission (FEC, such as form 3)</p>

<p>-(C) internal revenue service (IRS, such as the form 990)</p>

<p>-(D) department of justice/legal (PACER, decisions/opinions and docket information) </p>

<p>I noticed that the FEC form 3x, schedule A has the following information
<a href=""http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf"">http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any information copied from such Reports and Statements may not be sold or used by any person for the purpose of soliciting contributions or for commercial purposes, other than using the name and address of any political committee to solicit contributions from such committee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question 1:
How do I find the data license for these forms and what is their scope (eg does each form have a unique data policy, or is there a SEC or FEC or IRS or DOJ level policy?)</p>

<p>Question 2:
Is there a classification system for data use licenses for the US federal government?  (Is it possible to view a list of the possible data licenses?)</p>

<p>Question 3:
Suppose you or a third party aggregate data from something like FEC form 3x schedule A in a manner similar to something provided on data.gov (eg instead of total contribution to a political campaign, you want to provide total contribution to a political campaign by state, county or zip code).  How do you determine if there is a violation?  </p>

<p>Question 4:
How do you report a violation of these rules by a private party, and what are the repercussions? </p>

<p>Question 5:
These documents occasionally have information useful for identity theft in unredacted form (eg ages, DOB, social security numbers, medical record, bank account numbers).  What information should be redacted by the government before making documents public? (eg, is there a legal definition of what is private/public data?)  What is the protocol for reporting these incidents?  </p>

<p>These are probably best answered by a specialty lawyer (what is the specialty called?) for a commercial entity.  But does anybody have a good start?  I see Carl Malamud and Aaron Swartz's names come up a lot when searching for this data, so I know these topics have been well researched and (sadly) well prosecuted.</p>

<p>What is the StucHt information based on? Do I need to base it on some calculation like add 100' or something?</p>
