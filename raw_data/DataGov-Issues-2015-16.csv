EAS REGISTRY / GULF WAR EXAM / SODIUM DICHROMATE,Request #54621,,Friday September 2,, 2016 at 2:59 pm,,"Dear Sir: I work in the Compensation and Pension Dept in EPVAHCS. One of my functions is to enter data taken from the paper registry worksheets submitted by Veterans. The data is entered via the web interface (https://vaww.registries.aac.va.gov/eas/exam). I am currently working on the registries that are in the Incomplete Section of the database and the problem that I am encountering is the section on the Sodium Dichromate Exposures for Gulf War Exams. Some of the records listed in the Incomplete section are from the _OLD_ registry form (i.e. Persian Gulf Registry Code Sheet). These code sheets does not contain the question pertaining to Sodium Dichromate Exposures, and therefore I have to leave Sodium Dichromate Exposures section unanswered in the online registry. As you know, when it is left unanswered, a red X pops up and the Veteran_s registry remains in Incomplete Status. A suggestion is to add the option to select _UNKNOWN_ to the question _WAS VETERAN AT QARMAT ALI WATER TREATMENT PLANT IN IRAQ BETWEEN APRIL AND NOVEMBER 2003?_ Currently, the only options are _YES_ OR _NO_. I understand that it can be answered as _NO_ if the Veteran_s dates of service in the gulf does not meet the timeframe as stated in the question; but if service is within the timeframe and there is no reference to Sodium Dichromate in the old registry code sheet, how is the question answered without leaving it blank? Pls take into consideration that these old registry code sheets were the official forms for the Veterans to submit to the VA up until March 2010 when the newer version came out with the question on Sodium Dichromate Exposures. Veterans have moved out of area and no current number to contact Veteran to get the answer. Any guidance that you can provide to complete the status of records with this issue is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.",,,
