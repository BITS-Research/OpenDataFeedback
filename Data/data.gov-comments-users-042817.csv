<p><a href=""http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles2013/main"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles2013/main</a></p>

<p>And have been pretty successful at getting shapefiles for nearly all census-studied areas such as PUMA's (Public Use Microdata Areas), Counties, Census Block Groups, and so on. I have not however been successful at getting my hands on the MSA files there. There are CBSA files, which are to my knowledge a different, larger area-class of supra-metro regions.</p>

<p>I have access to census data for MSA regions, however, and was wondering where I might be able to get my hands on the MSA shapefile.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>There is one other possibility, however. I might be confused about the definitions of MSA's and learn that MSA's and Census ""Places"", as the regional data type is called at the data access points, are the same. They also have a shapefile set called ""Urban areas"", which is quite large and therefore I'm guessing fairly granular, so maybe that could be it, I don't know.</p>

<p>I definitely <strong>do not</strong> want accidentally start making consultancy-level evaluative comments based on inaccurate information due to different areas with some overlap but not 100% identical accidentally being confused for the same area though.</p>

<p>Quick example of that:</p>

<p>Confusing ""Greater Greenville"" (50 square mile area) in 2010 for the ""City of Greenville"" (20 square mile area) and saying, given the ""growth"" from 2000's 20 square mile area population to 2010's 50 square mile area population area and thinking that the city has undergone an high-density urban revolution in just 10 years. ""Greenville is blowing up!""</p>

<p>Any change of data-series title scares me a little to a lot so definitely looking for those MSA shapefiles. Fishing for edification on the census data structure though a bit too I guess, sorry mod's you can edit if you want</p>

<ul>
<li>Users to share:
<ul>
<li>tips for wrangling the data</li>
<li>known issues with the metadata and data</li>
<li>apps, visualisations &amp; articles related to the dataset</li>

<li>Government to:
<ul>
<li>respond to questions about the data</li>
<li>get feedback about what data is useful and where to improve</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Assuming there was budget to try and achieve these things, what would be the most effective way for government to do something? Comments on each dataset page? Host a forum? Twitter? Independent forums e.g. this one? All of these or just one?</p>

For my upcoming Capstone project, can someone please direct me to good resources that talks about <em>governmental open data at community level</em> :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why do cities in US and around the world use open data. What was
the need in the first place. (long term view)  </p></li>
<li><p>What are the pros and cons of using Indicators/ Signs. (History and
current usage). A good or a bad example.</p></li>
<li><p>Any academic study that is done from the users perspective. Who uses open data. What decisions do they make. Challenges user's face. (This is huge for me - users, audience. My goal is to understand the open data users - make it little easy for them and ultimately help the end users.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Pl let me know if I need to refine my questions or these are good to start. </p>

","69","949","2","","","","48394","3983","1","3994","","2014-11-07 15:30:43","","8","165","<p>I want to know when commercial use of US government data is permitted and for what uses.  Below, there are 5 questions that I have for 4 different primary data sources.  </p>

<p>So far, I have seen the data policy page at data.gov,
<a href=""http://www.data.gov/data-policy"">http://www.data.gov/data-policy</a>
that governs downloads (I am assuming?) only from that domain.</p>

<p>However, a lot of the primary source US government public data are not available or are partially available on data.gov (such as aggregates), but are publicly available including:</p>

<p>-(A) securities and exchange commission filings (SEC, such as the 10-Ks available on EDGAR)</p>

<p>-(B) federal elections commission (FEC, such as form 3)</p>

<p>-(C) internal revenue service (IRS, such as the form 990)</p>

<p>-(D) department of justice/legal (PACER, decisions/opinions and docket information) </p>

<p>I noticed that the FEC form 3x, schedule A has the following information
<a href=""http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf"">http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any information copied from such Reports and Statements may not be sold or used by any person for the purpose of soliciting contributions or for commercial purposes, other than using the name and address of any political committee to solicit contributions from such committee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question 1:
How do I find the data license for these forms and what is their scope (eg does each form have a unique data policy, or is there a SEC or FEC or IRS or DOJ level policy?)</p>

<p>Question 2:
Is there a classification system for data use licenses for the US federal government?  (Is it possible to view a list of the possible data licenses?)</p>

<p>Question 3:
Suppose you or a third party aggregate data from something like FEC form 3x schedule A in a manner similar to something provided on data.gov (eg instead of total contribution to a political campaign, you want to provide total contribution to a political campaign by state, county or zip code).  How do you determine if there is a violation?  </p>

<p>Question 4:
How do you report a violation of these rules by a private party, and what are the repercussions? </p>

<p>Question 5:
These documents occasionally have information useful for identity theft in unredacted form (eg ages, DOB, social security numbers, medical record, bank account numbers).  What information should be redacted by the government before making documents public? (eg, is there a legal definition of what is private/public data?)  What is the protocol for reporting these incidents?  </p>

<p>These are probably best answered by a specialty lawyer (what is the specialty called?) for a commercial entity.  But does anybody have a good start?  I see Carl Malamud and Aaron Swartz's names come up a lot when searching for this data, so I know these topics have been well researched and (sadly) well prosecuted.</p>

<p>Data: 
Consumer Expenditure Survey from the BLS (PUMD)</p>

<p>Files used: 
MTBI (expenditure by UCC codes) and FMLI (expenditure per category)</p>

<p>Goals:
1) Make a time series of FMLI data. 
2) Fine tune some FMLI variables by dropping some UCC from the MTBI files and reconstructing them.</p>

<p>Problem:
The same variable is sometimes constructed from different UCC.</p>

<p>For example:
The variable MAINRPPQ (Maintenance and repairs last quarter) in 2012 and 2013 CE files.</p>

<p>For 2012 the UCC used are:<br>
""470220 COOLANT/ADDITIVES/BRK/TRNS FLD""<br>
""480110 TIRES PURCHASED/REPLACED/INSTALL""<br>
""480212 VEHICLE PRODUCTS &amp; SERVICES""<br>
""480213 PARTS/EQUIP/ACCESSORIES""<br>
""480214 VEHICLE AUDIO EQUIPMENT""<br>
""480215 VEHICLE VIDEO EQUIPMENT""<br>

""490211 CLUTCH, TRANSMISSION REPAIR""<br>
""490212 DRIVE SHAFT AND REAR-END REPAIR""<br>
""490221 BRAKE WORK""<br>
""490231 REPAIR TO STEERING OR FRONT END""<br>
""490232 REPAIR TO ENGINE COOLING SYSTEM"" </p>

<p>but for 2013 the UCC are:<br>
""470220 COOLANT/ADDITIVES/BRK/TRNS FLD""<br>
""480110 TIRES PURCHASED/REPLACED/INSTALL""<br>
""480212 VEHICLE PRODUCTS &amp; SERVICES ""<br>

<li><p>The UCC that are in 2012 but not in 2013 variable still exist in the 2013 UCC text file and MTBI files. So, why were they dropped? From the description of the new UCC in 2013, I could not find the reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the UCC that exist in 2013 but not in 2012 were measured in 2012 but some were not.</p></li>
<li><p>I could not find documentation of what is going on without manually going through everything.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does proper documentation of UCC changes in the CE exist? If a code exists both in 2012 and 2013, but is not used in 2013, what is the reason? Please note that in 2013, ""Brake Work"" was dropped...</li>
<li>What should be my strategy for time series variables?</li>

<p>I am wondering if there have been any studies that have applied GAs to Open Data. <a href=""https://explore.data.gov/catalog/raw?category=Manufactures&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93"" rel=""nofollow"">Manufacturing</a> datasets are available on the <a href=""http://www.data.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">Data.gov</a> website, and I'm sure there are datasets out there somewhere for each of those other fields. I realize that not all research publications can be accessed for free, but I'm happy with just abstractions or summaries of projects.</p>

<p><strong>Have any studies applied GAs to Open Data? If so, please provide pointers to them in your answer.</strong></p>

What does this last field represent? Is there any way to find these ""census tract numbers""? For example, for the value ""census tract= 8100.2010"", where can I find data about that census tract number?</p>

<p>The results I receive are: </p>

<pre><code>Nb_census_tract = census_tract_of_address(""200 N State Chicago IL 60601"")
</code></pre>

<p>I found this definition: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Census Tract</strong>: The census is conducted by the US Census Bureau every 10 years. It identifies certain geographic areas by census tract
  and census block. The census track reflects median numbers when it
  comes to age and income. It is a generalization about a specific area,
  not by any means an exact science or number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried to load the shape file in Postgis, and I found census tract data on the official website, but it's not specific to every block/building in the city (I found something like: Poverty rate in city, ...) and most of data are older then 2010.  Then, I tried another approach--I found a <a href=""http://www.ffiec.gov/geocode/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">service</a> where it shows census information (even in 2014, although I couldn't find the dataset in the official website). But this service gives you information from an address. I don't want to do geocoding as it takes time and my data is huge.</p>

<p>As far as I know Decennial Census are the data where you can only get fundamental demographic and housing data. I tried to explore this <a href=""http://www.fcc.gov/developers/census-block-conversions-api"" rel=""nofollow"">API</a>, but it works by getting lat/long, but in my case I have polygons.</p>

<p>I thought about getting the center of the polygon, but it's not effective.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Where can I find data by ""census tract numbers"", for example: </p>

<p>Longitude: -122.338906797
latitude: 47.609284041
census tract number = 8100.2010</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles2013/main"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles2013/main</a></p>

<p>And have been pretty successful at getting shapefiles for nearly all census-studied areas such as PUMA's (Public Use Microdata Areas), Counties, Census Block Groups, and so on. I have not however been successful at getting my hands on the MSA files there. There are CBSA files, which are to my knowledge a different, larger area-class of supra-metro regions.</p>

<p>I have access to census data for MSA regions, however, and was wondering where I might be able to get my hands on the MSA shapefile.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>There is one other possibility, however. I might be confused about the definitions of MSA's and learn that MSA's and Census ""Places"", as the regional data type is called at the data access points, are the same. They also have a shapefile set called ""Urban areas"", which is quite large and therefore I'm guessing fairly granular, so maybe that could be it, I don't know.</p>

<p>I definitely <strong>do not</strong> want accidentally start making consultancy-level evaluative comments based on inaccurate information due to different areas with some overlap but not 100% identical accidentally being confused for the same area though.</p>

<p>Quick example of that:</p>

<p>Confusing ""Greater Greenville"" (50 square mile area) in 2010 for the ""City of Greenville"" (20 square mile area) and saying, given the ""growth"" from 2000's 20 square mile area population to 2010's 50 square mile area population area and thinking that the city has undergone an high-density urban revolution in just 10 years. ""Greenville is blowing up!""</p>

<p>Any change of data-series title scares me a little to a lot so definitely looking for those MSA shapefiles. Fishing for edification on the census data structure though a bit too I guess, sorry mod's you can edit if you want</p>

A local municipality has published a dataset of points of interest. Wikimapia has also a dataset for the same area but it is bigger and with more details than the official one.

It would also be nice to find a dataset that has been used in a previous study (so that I have a benchmark for my model). Many of the datasets in the literature appear to contain around N=1000 examples with about P=5-60 features. The only dataset that I have found so far is the <a href=""https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Qualitative_Bankruptcy"" rel=""nofollow"">qualitative bankruptcy</a> dataset on UCI (which is not great since it has been derived from other data, and processed substantially). </p>

Our prototype was previously using mocked data, and I am now trying to replace it with real data from the <a href=""http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Physician-and-Other-Supplier.html"" rel=""nofollow"">2012 Medicare Provider Utilization data set</a>.</p>

<p>Basically I feel like I have good data in front of me, but I'm not  sure how to intelligently interpret it. Below are two (abbreviated) example lines, each of which corresponds with one provider's costs relating to one medical procedure.</p>

<pre><code>avg_Medicare_allowed_amt    avg_submitted_chrg_amt    avg_Medicare_payment_amt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
      220.4492           |        517.3611         |          176.3583
      112.8608           |        1181.0625        |          90.2879
</code></pre>

<p>The methodology PDF including more detailed variable descriptions is <a href=""http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Downloads/Medicare-Physician-and-Other-Supplier-PUF-Methodology.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, variable definitions starting under heading 5 on page 4.</p>

<p>Each number corresponds with a dollar amount. <code>allowed_amt</code> is the amount that Medicare expects to pay that provider for that procedure, <code>submitted_chrg</code> is the amount that a provider actually bills medicare, and <code>payment_amt</code> is how much medicare actually reimburses. I also have unique IDs for each provider and procedure, as well as general identifying and geographical data.</p>

<p>What I want from this data is to be able to make an informed estimate of how much cost is actually incurred by the patient. In a less confusing world, this would just be <code>(avg submitted charge) - (amount reimbursed)</code> with the leftovers being passed on to the patient, but the way I understand this, Medicare billing does not really work this way, and the amount billed to Medicare does not really directly relate with the amount that a provider expects to be paid.</p>

<p>Is there any way from this data that I could make an educated estimate about how much a patient could expect to pay for a given procedure?</p>

<p>Rationale: I am trying to process and aggregate <a href=""http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/infrastructure/2014/Mobile_local_authority.csv"" rel=""nofollow"">Ofcom data for mobile network coverage</a> in the UK. For the districts of the UK, they list</p>

<p>for each of UK's four major mobile network operators (Vodafone, O2, Three, EE). Unfortunately, Ofcom doesn't mention the totals (or at least i haven't found them).</p>

<hr>

<p>Note: The Ofcom data is actually not distributed across UK <em>districts</em> throughout. Instead, it uses various levels of non-overlapping administrative units:</p>

<ul>
<li>All districts of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland</li>
<li>All 'Unitary Authorities' in England</li>
<li>All metropolitan districts in England</li>
<li>All counties in England with county councils ('shires')</li>
<li>Greater London is a single row.</li>

<p>Luckily they are all listed with their administrative ONS codes (with the exception of greater London which is listed with an extra code '00-London'), so it should be straightforward to reproduce the Ofcom aggregation.</p>

<p>So far, I have seen the data policy page at data.gov,
<a href=""http://www.data.gov/data-policy"">http://www.data.gov/data-policy</a>
that governs downloads (I am assuming?) only from that domain.</p>

<p>However, a lot of the primary source US government public data are not available or are partially available on data.gov (such as aggregates), but are publicly available including:</p>

<p>-(A) securities and exchange commission filings (SEC, such as the 10-Ks available on EDGAR)</p>

<p>-(B) federal elections commission (FEC, such as form 3)</p>

<p>-(C) internal revenue service (IRS, such as the form 990)</p>

<p>-(D) department of justice/legal (PACER, decisions/opinions and docket information) </p>

<p>I noticed that the FEC form 3x, schedule A has the following information
<a href=""http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf"">http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf</a></p>

  <p>Any information copied from such Reports and Statements may not be sold or used by any person for the purpose of soliciting contributions or for commercial purposes, other than using the name and address of any political committee to solicit contributions from such committee.</p>

How do I find the data license for these forms and what is their scope (eg does each form have a unique data policy, or is there a SEC or FEC or IRS or DOJ level policy?)</p>

<p>Question 2:
Is there a classification system for data use licenses for the US federal government?  (Is it possible to view a list of the possible data licenses?)</p>

<p>Question 3:
Suppose you or a third party aggregate data from something like FEC form 3x schedule A in a manner similar to something provided on data.gov (eg instead of total contribution to a political campaign, you want to provide total contribution to a political campaign by state, county or zip code).  How do you determine if there is a violation?  </p>

<p>Question 4:
How do you report a violation of these rules by a private party, and what are the repercussions? </p>

<p>Question 5:
These documents occasionally have information useful for identity theft in unredacted form (eg ages, DOB, social security numbers, medical record, bank account numbers).  What information should be redacted by the government before making documents public? (eg, is there a legal definition of what is private/public data?)  What is the protocol for reporting these incidents?  </p>

<p>These are probably best answered by a specialty lawyer (what is the specialty called?) for a commercial entity.  But does anybody have a good start?  I see Carl Malamud and Aaron Swartz's names come up a lot when searching for this data, so I know these topics have been well researched and (sadly) well prosecuted.</p>

What does this last field represent? Is there any way to find these ""census tract numbers""? For example, for the value ""census tract= 8100.2010"", where can I find data about that census tract number?</p>

<p>The results I receive are: </p>

<pre><code>Nb_census_tract = census_tract_of_address(""200 N State Chicago IL 60601"")
</code></pre>

<p>I found this definition: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Census Tract</strong>: The census is conducted by the US Census Bureau every 10 years. It identifies certain geographic areas by census tract
  and census block. The census track reflects median numbers when it
  comes to age and income. It is a generalization about a specific area,
  not by any means an exact science or number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried to load the shape file in Postgis, and I found census tract data on the official website, but it's not specific to every block/building in the city (I found something like: Poverty rate in city, ...) and most of data are older then 2010.  Then, I tried another approach--I found a <a href=""http://www.ffiec.gov/geocode/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">service</a> where it shows census information (even in 2014, although I couldn't find the dataset in the official website). But this service gives you information from an address. I don't want to do geocoding as it takes time and my data is huge.</p>

<p>As far as I know Decennial Census are the data where you can only get fundamental demographic and housing data. I tried to explore this <a href=""http://www.fcc.gov/developers/census-block-conversions-api"" rel=""nofollow"">API</a>, but it works by getting lat/long, but in my case I have polygons.</p>

<p>I thought about getting the center of the polygon, but it's not effective.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Where can I find data by ""census tract numbers"", for example: </p>

<p>Longitude: -122.338906797
latitude: 47.609284041
census tract number = 8100.2010</p>

<p>You can check : <a href=""https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/2014-City-Violent-Crimes-to-date/vmv9-kq5t"" rel=""nofollow"">https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/2014-City-Violent-Crimes-to-date/vmv9-kq5t</a></p></li>

<p>Right now, I am working for the USDA’s US Forest Service as a GIS Specialist and in totally I have worked for USDA's US Forest Service and NRCS for the past 15 years.</p>

<p>I taught American Sign Language at New Mexico State University from  January 2012 to May 2015. I hope to teach again somewhere in southern Colorado and Obviously I am the deaf GIS man! </p>

<p>I earned BA in Geography from California State University Fullerton and earned my GIS certificate from the University of California Riverside GIS Extension Program.
I taught American Sign Language at New Mexico State University from  January 2012 to May 2015. </p>

<p>I love the weather, world events, travel, network new people, exercise, internet, watch movies, of course sports !!, and teach students sign language.</p>

<p>The one thing I like about maps is 3D. It gives you the full concept of the area rather than having a 2D which gives you a vague picturesque in your mind!

Below, there are 5 questions that I have for 4 different primary data sources.  </p>

<p>So far, I have seen the data policy page at data.gov,
<a href=""http://www.data.gov/data-policy"">http://www.data.gov/data-policy</a>
that governs downloads (I am assuming?) only from that domain.</p>

<p>However, a lot of the primary source US government public data are not available or are partially available on data.gov (such as aggregates), but are publicly available including:</p>

<p>-(A) securities and exchange commission filings (SEC, such as the 10-Ks available on EDGAR)</p>

<p>-(B) federal elections commission (FEC, such as form 3)</p>

<p>-(C) internal revenue service (IRS, such as the form 990)</p>

<p>-(D) department of justice/legal (PACER, decisions/opinions and docket information) </p>

<p>I noticed that the FEC form 3x, schedule A has the following information
<a href=""http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf"">http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any information copied from such Reports and Statements may not be sold or used by any person for the purpose of soliciting contributions or for commercial purposes, other than using the name and address of any political committee to solicit contributions from such committee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question 1:
How do I find the data license for these forms and what is their scope (eg does each form have a unique data policy, or is there a SEC or FEC or IRS or DOJ level policy?)</p>

<p>Question 2:
Is there a classification system for data use licenses for the US federal government?  (Is it possible to view a list of the possible data licenses?)</p>

<p>Question 3:
Suppose you or a third party aggregate data from something like FEC form 3x schedule A in a manner similar to something provided on data.gov (eg instead of total contribution to a political campaign, you want to provide total contribution to a political campaign by state, county or zip code).  How do you determine if there is a violation?  </p>

<p>Question 4:
How do you report a violation of these rules by a private party, and what are the repercussions? </p>

<p>Question 5:
These documents occasionally have information useful for identity theft in unredacted form (eg ages, DOB, social security numbers, medical record, bank account numbers).  What information should be redacted by the government before making documents public? (eg, is there a legal definition of what is private/public data?)  What is the protocol for reporting these incidents?  </p>

<p>These are probably best answered by a specialty lawyer (what is the specialty called?) for a commercial entity.  But does anybody have a good start?  I see Carl Malamud and Aaron Swartz's names come up a lot when searching for this data, so I know these topics have been well researched and (sadly) well prosecuted.</p>

Some definitions of what the USG considers ""economic growth/infrastructure"" would be useful (like, does it include telecoms? Roads? schools? - or would those go elsewhere?"" This list is equivalent to the OECD DAC sector listings (under IATI) - having this published in machine readable formats would go a long way to making it easier to tag projects and data with correct classifications.","2015-03-24 15:44:18","","6014","6014","53","2015-03-20 01:05:36","Siobhan Green","2016-02-05 21:35:49","http://www.sonjara.com","Falls Church, VA","<p>Co-founder of woman owned IT firm specializing in open data for international development and social benefit.

<p>Data: 
Consumer Expenditure Survey from the BLS (PUMD)</p>

<p>Files used: 
MTBI (expenditure by UCC codes) and FMLI (expenditure per category)</p>

<p>Goals:
1) Make a time series of FMLI data. 
2) Fine tune some FMLI variables by dropping some UCC from the MTBI files and reconstructing them.</p>

<p>Problem:
The same variable is sometimes constructed from different UCC.</p>

<p>For example:
The variable MAINRPPQ (Maintenance and repairs last quarter) in 2012 and 2013 CE files.</p>

<p>For 2012 the UCC used are:<br>
""470220 COOLANT/ADDITIVES/BRK/TRNS FLD""<br>
""480110 TIRES PURCHASED/REPLACED/INSTALL""<br>
""480212 VEHICLE PRODUCTS &amp; SERVICES""<br>
""480213 PARTS/EQUIP/ACCESSORIES""<br>
""480214 VEHICLE AUDIO EQUIPMENT""<br>
""480215 VEHICLE VIDEO EQUIPMENT""<br>
""490110 BODY WORK AND PAINTING""<br>
""490211 CLUTCH, TRANSMISSION REPAIR""<br>
""490212 DRIVE SHAFT AND REAR-END REPAIR""<br>
""490221 BRAKE WORK""<br>
""490231 REPAIR TO STEERING OR FRONT END""<br>
""490232 REPAIR TO ENGINE COOLING SYSTEM"" </p>

<p>but for 2013 the UCC are:<br>
""470220 COOLANT/ADDITIVES/BRK/TRNS FLD""<br>
""480110 TIRES PURCHASED/REPLACED/INSTALL""<br>
""480212 VEHICLE PRODUCTS &amp; SERVICES ""<br>
""480213 PARTS/EQUIP/ACCESSORIES""<br>
""480215 VEHICLE VIDEO EQUIPMENT""<br>
""480216 VEHICLE CLEAN SRVCS INCL CARWASH""<br>
""490110 BODY WORK AND PAINTING""<br>
""490232 REPAIR TO ENGINE COOLING SYSTEM""<br>
""490300 VEHICLE OR ENGINE REPAIRS""<br>
""490311 MOTOR TUNE-UP""<br>
""490312 LUBE, OIL CHANGE AND OIL FILTERS""<br>
""490313 FRNT END ALIGN, WHEEL BAL/ROTAT""<br>
""490314 SHOCK ABSORBER REPLACEMENT""<br>
""490318 TIRE REPAIR AND OTH REPAIR WORK""<br>
""490501 VEHICLE ACCESSORIES INCL. LABOR""<br>
""490900 AUTO REPAIR SERVICE POLICY""           </p>

<p>There are five issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>UCC that are in the 2012 variable but are not in the 2013 variable:<br>
""480214 VEHICLE AUDIO EQUIPMENT""<br>
""490211 CLUTCH, TRANSMISSION REPAIR""<br>
""490212 DRIVE SHAFT AND REAR-END REPAIR""<br>
""490221 BRAKE WORK""<br>
""490231 REPAIR TO STEERING OR FRONT END""</p></li>
<li><p>UUC that are in the 2013 varaible but are not in the 2012 variable:<br>
""480216 VEHICLE CLEAN SRVCS INCL CARWASH""<br>
""490300 VEHICLE OR ENGINE REPAIRS""<br>
""490311 MOTOR TUNE-UP""<br>
""490312 LUBE, OIL CHANGE AND OIL FILTERS""<br>
""490313 FRNT END ALIGN, WHEEL BAL/ROTAT""<br>
""490314 SHOCK ABSORBER REPLACEMENT""<br>
""490318 TIRE REPAIR AND OTH REPAIR WORK""<br>
""490501 VEHICLE ACCESSORIES INCL. LABOR""<br>
""490900 AUTO REPAIR SERVICE POLICY""    </p></li>
<li><p>The UCC that are in 2012 but not in 2013 variable still exist in the 2013 UCC text file and MTBI files. So, why were they dropped? From the description of the new UCC in 2013, I could not find the reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the UCC that exist in 2013 but not in 2012 were measured in 2012 but some were not.</p></li>
<li><p>I could not find documentation of what is going on without manually going through everything.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does proper documentation of UCC changes in the CE exist? If a code exists both in 2012 and 2013, but is not used in 2013, what is the reason? Please note that in 2013, ""Brake Work"" was dropped...</li>
<li>What should be my strategy for time series variables?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I have now managed to harvest the CKAN API, by increasing the allowed timeout from 5 to 10 seconds.
