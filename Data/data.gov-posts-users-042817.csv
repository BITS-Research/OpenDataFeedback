<p>The main benefit seems to build feedback loop, encouraging use of the data and release of the data. Specifically, these sorts of activities are what users and government might want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users to share:
<ul>
<li>tips for wrangling the data</li>
<li>known issues with the metadata and data</li>
<li>apps, visualisations &amp; articles related to the dataset</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Government to:
<ul>
<li>respond to questions about the data</li>
<li>get feedback about what data is useful and where to improve</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming there was budget to try and achieve these things, what would be the most effective way for government to do something? Comments on each dataset page? Host a forum? Twitter? Independent forums e.g. this one? All of these or just one?</p>

I am i This type of information is pretty hard to come by, so I thought that perhaps there might be some decent proxy variables for income, such as consumption information, or living standards, even child mortality.

We're working on a blog post rounding up the most common reasons cited by governments to not release data** and then refuting each one. </p>

<p>We've rounded up the reasons cited for not releasing data, but now we're trying to refute each one. We're hoping to round up ideas by Sept. 9. </p>

<p>So, we're curious: 
What are your best responses when people tell you they can't open data? / 
What are the best responses you've heard (or given) for releasing or sharing data?</p>

<p>*EDIT on Sept. 4: Thanks for the feedback, all! We're working toward sharing the crowdsourced list of reasons people have given us for not releasing data, and at that time we'll re-open the discussion on reasons TO release data. </p>

<p>**EDIT on Sept. 5: We've posted a blog rounding up the reasons people have cited for NOT releasing data and have re-issued the challenge to help refute each reason. Learn more here: <a href=""http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/09/05/reasons-not-to-release-data/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/09/05/reasons-not-to-release-data/</a></p>

<p>**EDIT on Sept. 16: Thanks to everyone who has responded on the Google doc or through this platform. We're rounding up all the reasons and responses now, and we'll be sure to share it here. </p>

<p>**FInal update on Sept. 30: We are now starting to roll out the rebuttals as blog posts, and the first one went live today: <a href=""http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/09/30/reasons-to-not-release-data-part-1-apathy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/09/30/reasons-to-not-release-data-part-1-apathy/</a> </p>

<p>Thanks so much to all of you who contributed ideas for this project throughout its evolution! We couldn't have done it without the help of so many different perspectives, and we feel the end result is richer for it.

It would also be nice to find a dataset that has been used in a previous study (so that I have a benchmark for my model). Many of the datasets in the literature appear to contain around N=1000 examples with about P=5-60 features. The only dataset that I have found so far is the <a href=""https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Qualitative_Bankruptcy"" rel=""nofollow"">qualitative bankruptcy</a> dataset on UCI (which is not great since it has been derived from other data, and processed substantially). </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles2013/main"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles2013/main</a></p>

<p>And have been pretty successful at getting shapefiles for nearly all census-studied areas such as PUMA's (Public Use Microdata Areas), Counties, Census Block Groups, and so on. I have not however been successful at getting my hands on the MSA files there. There are CBSA files, which are to my knowledge a different, larger area-class of supra-metro regions.</p>

<p>I have access to census data for MSA regions, however, and was wondering where I might be able to get my hands on the MSA shapefile.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>There is one other possibility, however. I might be confused about the definitions of MSA's and learn that MSA's and Census ""Places"", as the regional data type is called at the data access points, are the same. They also have a shapefile set called ""Urban areas"", which is quite large and therefore I'm guessing fairly granular, so maybe that could be it, I don't know.</p>

<p>I definitely <strong>do not</strong> want accidentally start making consultancy-level evaluative comments based on inaccurate information due to different areas with some overlap but not 100% identical accidentally being confused for the same area though.</p>

<p>Quick example of that:</p>

<p>Confusing ""Greater Greenville"" (50 square mile area) in 2010 for the ""City of Greenville"" (20 square mile area) and saying, given the ""growth"" from 2000's 20 square mile area population to 2010's 50 square mile area population area and thinking that the city has undergone an high-density urban revolution in just 10 years. ""Greenville is blowing up!""</p>

<p>Any change of data-series title scares me a little to a lot so definitely looking for those MSA shapefiles. Fishing for edification on the census data structure though a bit too I guess, sorry mod's you can edit if you want</p>

"1877","1","","","2014-04-02 00:24:30","","2","699","<p>I am using an API (To get crimes in city ) where I have found a field entitled ""Census Tract Number"" and am getting data formatted with (longitude, latitude, census tract number). What does this last field represent? Is there any way to find these ""census tract numbers""? For example, for the value ""census tract= 8100.2010"", where can I find data about that census tract number?</p>

<p>The results I receive are: </p>

<pre><code>Nb_census_tract = census_tract_of_address(""200 N State Chicago IL 60601"")
</code></pre>

<p>I found this definition: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Census Tract</strong>: The census is conducted by the US Census Bureau every 10 years. It identifies certain geographic areas by census tract
  and census block. The census track reflects median numbers when it
  comes to age and income. It is a generalization about a specific area,
  not by any means an exact science or number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried to load the shape file in Postgis, and I found census tract data on the official website, but it's not specific to every block/building in the city (I found something like: Poverty rate in city, ...) and most of data are older then 2010.  Then, I tried another approach--I found a <a href=""http://www.ffiec.gov/geocode/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">service</a> where it shows census information (even in 2014, although I couldn't find the dataset in the official website). But this service gives you information from an address. I don't want to do geocoding as it takes time and my data is huge.</p>

<p>As far as I know Decennial Census are the data where you can only get fundamental demographic and housing data. I tried to explore this <a href=""http://www.fcc.gov/developers/census-block-conversions-api"" rel=""nofollow"">API</a>, but it works by getting lat/long, but in my case I have polygons.</p>

<p>I thought about getting the center of the polygon, but it's not effective.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Where can I find data by ""census tract numbers"", for example: </p>

<p>Longitude: -122.338906797
latitude: 47.609284041
census tract number = 8100.2010</p>

<li><p>Can I find updated census tract data (as far as I know, all data is before 2010)? </p></li>

<p>This returns just one patient record with 5 reactions (""ASTHENIA"", ""DISEASE RECURRENCE"", ""DIZZINESS"", ""TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK"", ""VERTIGO"") and one drug (""AGGRENOX"").</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?search=patient.drug.openfda.pharm_class_epc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?search=patient.drug.openfda.pharm_class_epc</a>:""nonsteroidal+anti-inflammatory+drug""&amp;count=patient.reaction.reactionmeddrapt.exact</p>

<p>This returns counts for 100 reactions (e.g., ""ABDOMINAL DISCOMFORT"", ""ABDOMINAL PAIN UPPER"", ... , ""WEIGHT DECREASED"", ""WEIGHT INCREASED"").</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The results from the second query are to be expected since NonSteroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used. My guess is that the 100 record limit is the default.</p>

<p>My question is: why does the first query return only one (random) patient record? The documentation implies that, by default, the API will return up to the first 1000 records.</p>

<p>I'm trying to obtain the Soil Type using the Vs30 API. Here is the link for the documentation: <a href=""http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/apps/vs30/documentation.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/apps/vs30/documentation.php</a>.</p>

<p>So far I'm receiving information from USGS in the correct form, yet the files are either empty or simply do not exist. Each file 'size' is returned 'false' and following the url provided lands me on the 'page not found' page. I am using jQuery.ajax() to call a php document using cURL to post my request. As stated before, I get the correct format returned, yet the files are unusable. Using wget through bash has also return empty files.</p>

<p>Here is my code for the Vs30 API:</p>

<p><strong>jQuery:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var dataObj = {
        json: 'true', 
        site_name: 'model', 
        top_left_lat: 34.00, 
        top_left_lon: -122.00,
        bottom_right_lat: 34.01, 
        bottom_right_lon: -121.99, 
        slope_type: 'stable',
        output_types: ['jpg', 'txt', 'grd']
    };

$.ajax({
    url: /php/vs30.php,
    type: 'POST',
    dataType: 'json',
    crossDomain: true,
    data: dataObj,
    success: function(data) {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>PHP:</strong></p>

<pre><code>$curl = curl_init();
curl_setopt_array($curl, array(
    CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER =&gt; 1,
    CURLOPT_URL =&gt; 'http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/apps/vs30/vs30.php',
    CURLOPT_USERAGENT =&gt; 'Codular Sample cURL Request',
    CURLOPT_POST =&gt; 1,
    CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS =&gt; ""json=true&amp;site_name=model&amp;top_left_lat=34&amp;top_left_lon=-122&amp;bottom_right_lat=33.89&amp;bottom_right_lon=-122.11&amp;slope_type=stable&amp;output_types[]=jpg&amp;output_types[]=xyz&amp;output_types[]=grd""
    )
);
$resp = curl_exec($curl);
curl_close($curl);
echo $resp;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I have hard coded the request inside the PHP script temporarily. Here is the response I get from USGS:</p>

<p><strong>Chrome Console:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Object {jpg: Object, grd: Object, xyz: Object}

</code></pre>

<p>I <em>think</em> that the other API calls (GET http requests) are relatively the same process, so if I get this figured out, I can call the other APIs with no problem. If my thinking is wrong, please let me know and how to go about the other APIs (geohazards . usgs . gov/hazardtool/application.php &lt;-- Click on the tab ""Data Access"", and earthquake . usgs . gov/hazards/designmaps/usdesigndoc.php &lt;-- located at the bottom of the page).</p>

Our prototype was previously using mocked data, and I am now trying to replace it with real data from the <a href=""http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Physician-and-Other-Supplier.html"" rel=""nofollow"">2012 Medicare Provider Utilization data set</a>.</p>

<p>Basically I feel like I have good data in front of me, but I'm not  sure how to intelligently interpret it. Below are two (abbreviated) example lines, each of which corresponds with one provider's costs relating to one medical procedure.</p>

<pre><code>avg_Medicare_allowed_amt    avg_submitted_chrg_amt    avg_Medicare_payment_amt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
      220.4492           |        517.3611         |          176.3583
      112.8608           |        1181.0625        |          90.2879
</code></pre>

<p>The methodology PDF including more detailed variable descriptions is <a href=""http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Downloads/Medicare-Physician-and-Other-Supplier-PUF-Methodology.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, variable definitions starting under heading 5 on page 4.</p>

<p>Each number corresponds with a dollar amount. <code>allowed_amt</code> is the amount that Medicare expects to pay that provider for that procedure, <code>submitted_chrg</code> is the amount that a provider actually bills medicare, and <code>payment_amt</code> is how much medicare actually reimburses. I also have unique IDs for each provider and procedure, as well as general identifying and geographical data.</p>

<p>What I want from this data is to be able to make an informed estimate of how much cost is actually incurred by the patient. In a less confusing world, this would just be <code>(avg submitted charge) - (amount reimbursed)</code> with the leftovers being passed on to the patient, but the way I understand this, Medicare billing does not really work this way, and the amount billed to Medicare does not really directly relate with the amount that a provider expects to be paid.</p>

<p>Is there any way from this data that I could make an educated estimate about how much a patient could expect to pay for a given procedure?</p>

"3983","1","3994","","2014-11-07 15:30:43","","8","165","<p>I want to know when commercial use of US government data is permitted and for what uses.  Below, there are 5 questions that I have for 4 different primary data sources.  </p>

<p>So far, I have seen the data policy page at data.gov,
<a href=""http://www.data.gov/data-policy"">http://www.data.gov/data-policy</a>
that governs downloads (I am assuming?) only from that domain.</p>

<p>However, a lot of the primary source US government public data are not available or are partially available on data.gov (such as aggregates), but are publicly available including:</p>

<p>-(A) securities and exchange commission filings (SEC, such as the 10-Ks available on EDGAR)</p>

<p>-(B) federal elections commission (FEC, such as form 3)</p>

<p>-(C) internal revenue service (IRS, such as the form 990)</p>

<p>-(D) department of justice/legal (PACER, decisions/opinions and docket information) </p>

<p>I noticed that the FEC form 3x, schedule A has the following information
<a href=""http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf"">http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any information copied from such Reports and Statements may not be sold or used by any person for the purpose of soliciting contributions or for commercial purposes, other than using the name and address of any political committee to solicit contributions from such committee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question 1:
How do I find the data license for these forms and what is their scope (eg does each form have a unique data policy, or is there a SEC or FEC or IRS or DOJ level policy?)</p>

<p>Question 2:
Is there a classification system for data use licenses for the US federal government?  (Is it possible to view a list of the possible data licenses?)</p>

<p>Question 3:
Suppose you or a third party aggregate data from something like FEC form 3x schedule A in a manner similar to something provided on data.gov (eg instead of total contribution to a political campaign, you want to provide total contribution to a political campaign by state, county or zip code).  How do you determine if there is a violation?  </p>

<p>Question 4:
How do you report a violation of these rules by a private party, and what are the repercussions? </p>

<p>Question 5:
These documents occasionally have information useful for identity theft in unredacted form (eg ages, DOB, social security numbers, medical record, bank account numbers).  What information should be redacted by the government before making documents public? (eg, is there a legal definition of what is private/public data?)  What is the protocol for reporting these incidents?  </p>

<p>These are probably best answered by a specialty lawyer (what is the specialty called?) for a commercial entity.  But does anybody have a good start?  I see Carl Malamud and Aaron Swartz's names come up a lot when searching for this data, so I know these topics have been well researched and (sadly) well prosecuted.</p>

Wanting to know what qualifies a substance as pharmaceutical grade I did some googling and found the <a href=""http://www.usp.org"" rel=""nofollow"">USP</a>, which apparently sets drug purity standards for the FDA. But in visiting the USP website I find a USP dictionary will set me back $378.00.

<p>openFDA label database doesn't seem to include any information on purity standards, just standard doses and dosages.</p>

<p>I'm incredulous that the definition of <em>Pharmaceutical Grade</em> for any given substance adopted by the FDA should be a secret I have to pay nearly $400 to learn. So my question is, is there some source I'm missing, either within, or outside openFDA?</p>

<p>Rationale: I am trying to process and aggregate <a href=""http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/infrastructure/2014/Mobile_local_authority.csv"" rel=""nofollow"">Ofcom data for mobile network coverage</a> in the UK. For the districts of the UK, they list</p>

<p>for each of UK's four major mobile network operators (Vodafone, O2, Three, EE). Unfortunately, Ofcom doesn't mention the totals (or at least i haven't found them).</p>

<hr>

<p>Note: The Ofcom data is actually not distributed across UK <em>districts</em> throughout. Instead, it uses various levels of non-overlapping administrative units:</p>

<ul>
<li>All districts of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland</li>
<li>All 'Unitary Authorities' in England</li>
<li>All metropolitan districts in England</li>
<li>All counties in England with county councils ('shires')</li>
<li>Greater London is a single row.</li>

<p>Luckily they are all listed with their administrative ONS codes (with the exception of greater London which is listed with an extra code '00-London'), so it should be straightforward to reproduce the Ofcom aggregation.</p>

  acquires a key and stores it for use by the app. This then gives each

I want to do version control of my views
Many times I want to use the same map or view with different datasets.</p>

<p>The answer ""Version control can be done with the abcd-wxyz Socrata unique identifier at the end of the URL is not very useful.

<p>Once I have a local copy of the schema, I could then generate the same type of view by uploading it to a different data set. Perhaps a different dataset on the same open data portal. Perhaps the same type of dataset at a different open data portal.</p>

<p>It would also aid me when importing new datasets. If the dataset was incident or ticket type data I could then import a standard set of views. A map, bar charts of types, age or status.</p>

<p>I like the Socrata web UI. It is easy to use and fairly powerful. It would be nice to be able to also manage the view schemas the same way I manage code or in my case as a Linux systems administrator, operating system/application configurations.</p>

<p>Data: 
Consumer Expenditure Survey from the BLS (PUMD)</p>

<p>Files used: 
MTBI (expenditure by UCC codes) and FMLI (expenditure per category)</p>

<p>Goals:
1) Make a time series of FMLI data. 
2) Fine tune some FMLI variables by dropping some UCC from the MTBI files and reconstructing them.</p>

<p>Problem:
The same variable is sometimes constructed from different UCC.</p>

<p>For example:
The variable MAINRPPQ (Maintenance and repairs last quarter) in 2012 and 2013 CE files.</p>

<p>For 2012 the UCC used are:<br>
""470220 COOLANT/ADDITIVES/BRK/TRNS FLD""<br>
""480110 TIRES PURCHASED/REPLACED/INSTALL""<br>
""480212 VEHICLE PRODUCTS &amp; SERVICES""<br>
""480213 PARTS/EQUIP/ACCESSORIES""<br>
""480214 VEHICLE AUDIO EQUIPMENT""<br>
""480215 VEHICLE VIDEO EQUIPMENT""<br>
""490110 BODY WORK AND PAINTING""<br>
""490211 CLUTCH, TRANSMISSION REPAIR""<br>
""490212 DRIVE SHAFT AND REAR-END REPAIR""<br>
""490221 BRAKE WORK""<br>
""490231 REPAIR TO STEERING OR FRONT END""<br>
""490232 REPAIR TO ENGINE COOLING SYSTEM"" </p>

<p>but for 2013 the UCC are:<br>
""470220 COOLANT/ADDITIVES/BRK/TRNS FLD""<br>
""480110 TIRES PURCHASED/REPLACED/INSTALL""<br>
""480212 VEHICLE PRODUCTS &amp; SERVICES ""<br>
""480213 PARTS/EQUIP/ACCESSORIES""<br>
""480215 VEHICLE VIDEO EQUIPMENT""<br>
""480216 VEHICLE CLEAN SRVCS INCL CARWASH""<br>
""490110 BODY WORK AND PAINTING""<br>
""490232 REPAIR TO ENGINE COOLING SYSTEM""<br>
""490300 VEHICLE OR ENGINE REPAIRS""<br>
""490311 MOTOR TUNE-UP""<br>
""490312 LUBE, OIL CHANGE AND OIL FILTERS""<br>
""490313 FRNT END ALIGN, WHEEL BAL/ROTAT""<br>
""490314 SHOCK ABSORBER REPLACEMENT""<br>
""490318 TIRE REPAIR AND OTH REPAIR WORK""<br>
""490501 VEHICLE ACCESSORIES INCL. LABOR""<br>
""490900 AUTO REPAIR SERVICE POLICY""           </p>

<p>There are five issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>UCC that are in the 2012 variable but are not in the 2013 variable:<br>
""480214 VEHICLE AUDIO EQUIPMENT""<br>
""490211 CLUTCH, TRANSMISSION REPAIR""<br>
""490212 DRIVE SHAFT AND REAR-END REPAIR""<br>
""490221 BRAKE WORK""<br>
""490231 REPAIR TO STEERING OR FRONT END""</p></li>
<li><p>UUC that are in the 2013 varaible but are not in the 2012 variable:<br>
""480216 VEHICLE CLEAN SRVCS INCL CARWASH""<br>
""490300 VEHICLE OR ENGINE REPAIRS""<br>
""490311 MOTOR TUNE-UP""<br>
""490312 LUBE, OIL CHANGE AND OIL FILTERS""<br>
""490313 FRNT END ALIGN, WHEEL BAL/ROTAT""<br>
""490314 SHOCK ABSORBER REPLACEMENT""<br>
""490318 TIRE REPAIR AND OTH REPAIR WORK""<br>
""490501 VEHICLE ACCESSORIES INCL. LABOR""<br>
""490900 AUTO REPAIR SERVICE POLICY""    </p></li>
<li><p>The UCC that are in 2012 but not in 2013 variable still exist in the 2013 UCC text file and MTBI files. So, why were they dropped? From the description of the new UCC in 2013, I could not find the reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the UCC that exist in 2013 but not in 2012 were measured in 2012 but some were not.</p></li>
<li><p>I could not find documentation of what is going on without manually going through everything.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does proper documentation of UCC changes in the CE exist? If a code exists both in 2012 and 2013, but is not used in 2013, what is the reason? Please note that in 2013, ""Brake Work"" was dropped...</li>
<li>What should be my strategy for time series variables?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you.</p>

Alternatively, state-level monthly unemployment data on low-wage earners for 2014/2015 would work as well.

If I could find this data at the yearly level for 2014 and 2015 instead of the monthly level, that wouldn't be too bad. It wouldn't be quite as useful as monthly, but I could still run the regression and get some results. The other elements are pretty crucial though. Thanks!!</p>

<p>I'm coming at this from a GIS background and am trying to create a database that resembles the information available on this portal: <a href=""http://www.giscoeapp.lrc.gov.on.ca/CLUPA/Index.html?site=CLUPA&amp;viewer=CLUPA&amp;locale=en-US"" rel=""nofollow"">Crown Land Use Policy Atlas Ontario</a>. Crown land is generally federal land that isn't zoned as urban/developed, agricultural, privately owned, or an environmental protected area.</p>

<p>Since a portal like this doesn't exist for Quebec, I figured that this could be teased out using the following open licensed information and data:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-2011-eng.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">Census Boundaries for Land, Water, and other limits (StatsCan)</a></li>

<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unorganized_territories_in_Quebec"" rel=""nofollow"">Unorganized Regions of Quebec (Wikipedia)</a></li>

</ul>

<p>I would like to know if there exists either an open licensed shape of crown lands available for Quebec or, alternatively, an open licensed boundary of Resource Extraction Areas (French: <code>Zone d'exploitation contrôlée</code>, or <code>ZECs</code>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_d&#39;exploitation_contr%C3%B4l%C3%A9e"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a>), as that is the final piece of information I need to ascertain what is technically ""Crown Land"" from the information I've gathered.</p>

<p>Any advice on the Crown Land identification approach is also appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>Do you know what type of data I need? I know I need a database of wind speed, direction, and possibly turbulence and shear. My questions are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do you know of a specific database I can use with wind data and files I can download for my algorithm? So far I have these two sites:       </p>

</ul></li>
<li><p>Are these good options? Can I download one of these files to use in MATLAB?</p></li>
<li><p>Do I also need data of past energy outputs of the wind turbines I am focusing on (for comparison of my prediction with the actual data)?</p></li>

<p><code>length(unique(pumas.points$id))</code><br>

<p>This data I am able to map with ggplot2. For my ACS data, instead of id numbers 0-264 I have each 5 digit PUMA code, like so.</p>

<pre><code>test

<p><code>1:  08513 0.3647587</code><br>

I do have an apiKey for api.data.gov (Is this actually valid for the CKAN API?), but if I include this as 'Authorization' in the http header, still timeouts occur. </li>
<li>Using an offset of 42000, often only 998 packages are returned, although it is still far from the end of the list (192.633). This occurs by doing the following request: <a href=""http://catalog.data.gov/api/3/action/package_search?rows=1000&amp;start=42000"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://catalog.data.gov/api/3/action/package_search?rows=1000&amp;start=42000</a>. Other times it actually does return 1000 results here, but returns 998 results on a later page...</li>
</ol>

<p>Can I do anything on my end to prevent the throttling from occuring, or is something else wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Update 19-3-2017</strong>:</p>

<p>I have now managed to harvest the CKAN API, by increasing the allowed timeout from 5 to 10 seconds. Still it takes quite some time to harvest all of the data, since most of the download occurs at speeds around 100 kb/s. Also, I do get a page with 998 results occasionally, although I correct for this by setting only increasing the 'start' parameter by 998 if this happens.</p>

<p>Things I tried to prevent the apparent throttling:</p>

<ul>
<li>Included pauses of up to 10 seconds between requests</li>
<li>Using a different network: Tried this both on a glass-fiber connection (150/150), and a slower VDSL network (Both from the Netherlands)</li>
<li>Tried both with the api.data.gov API key as 'Authorization' in the request header, as well as without</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there an updated dataset that covers a time after 2003? Are there other text datasets relevant to NSF grants, or research funded by the NSF?</p>

<p>data.gov has some data, but it doesn't seem like they have any text data describing proposals/grants from this period. Even a link to a website that we can scrape would be helpful.</p>
